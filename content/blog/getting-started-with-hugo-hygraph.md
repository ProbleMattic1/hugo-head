# Getting Started with Hugo and Hygraph

Combining Hugo's static site generation with Hygraph's headless CMS creates a powerful, fast, and maintainable website solution. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up this integration.

## Why This Combination Works

### Hugo's Strengths
- **Performance**: Static sites are incredibly fast
- **Security**: No database vulnerabilities
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of pages
- **SEO**: Perfect for search engine optimization

### Hygraph's Benefits
- **Developer Experience**: GraphQL API
- **Content Management**: User-friendly interface
- **Flexibility**: Schema customization
- **Collaboration**: Team-friendly workflows

## Setting Up the Integration

### Step 1: Create Your Hygraph Project

1. Sign up for a Hygraph account
2. Create a new project
3. Define your content models
4. Add some sample content

### Step 2: Configure Hugo

```javascript
// In your Hugo templates
{{ $options := dict
  "method" "POST"
  "headers" (dict "Content-Type" "application/json")
  "body" `{"query": "{ blogPosts { title description slug } }"}`
}}
{{ $data := resources.GetRemote "https://api.hygraph.com/v2/your_project_id/master" $options }}
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Deploy your Hugo site to platforms like Netlify or Vercel, and connect your Hygraph project for automatic rebuilds when content changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Cache API responses** to improve build times
2. **Use environment variables** for API endpoints
3. **Implement error handling** for failed API calls
4. **Optimize images** through Hygraph's asset management

## Conclusion

This setup gives you the best of both worlds: the speed and security of static sites with the flexibility of a headless CMS. Your content creators can manage content easily while developers maintain full control over the site structure and styling.
