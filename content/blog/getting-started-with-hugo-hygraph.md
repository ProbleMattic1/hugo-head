# Getting Started with Hugo and Headless CMS

Combining Hugo's static site generation with a headless CMS creates a powerful, fast, and maintainable website solution. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up this integration.

## Why This Combination Works

### Hugo's Strengths
- **Performance**: Static sites are incredibly fast
- **Security**: No database vulnerabilities
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of pages
- **SEO**: Perfect for search engine optimization

### Headless CMS Benefits
- **Developer Experience**: GraphQL/REST API
- **Content Management**: User-friendly interface
- **Flexibility**: Schema customization
- **Collaboration**: Team-friendly workflows

## Setting Up the Integration

### Step 1: Create Your CMS Project

1. Choose a headless CMS (Strapi, Sanity, Hygraph, Contentful, etc.)
2. Create a new project/workspace
3. Define your content models
4. Add some sample content

### Step 2: Configure Hugo

```javascript
// In your Hugo templates
{{ $options := dict
  "method" "POST"
  "headers" (dict "Content-Type" "application/json")
  "body" `{"query": "{ blogPosts { title description slug } }"}`
}}
{{ $data := resources.GetRemote "https://api.your-cms.com/endpoint" $options }}
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Deploy your Hugo site to platforms like Netlify or Vercel, and connect your CMS project for automatic rebuilds when content changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Cache API responses** to improve build times
2. **Use environment variables** for API endpoints
3. **Implement error handling** for failed API calls
4. **Optimize images** through your CMS's asset management

## Conclusion

This setup gives you the best of both worlds: the speed and security of static sites with the flexibility of a headless CMS. Your content creators can manage content easily while developers maintain full control over the site structure and styling.

Ready to get started? Check out the documentation for your chosen CMS (Strapi, Sanity, Hygraph, Contentful, etc.) for more detailed setup instructions.
